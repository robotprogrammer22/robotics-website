			<h1>2016</h1>
			<h2>Stronghold</h2>
			<p class="center">
				In 2016 the game was called "Stronghold." The idea in this game was to break through the opponent's 
                defensives and storm the castle. This was represented on the field by various obstacles that changed 
                every match, and each obstacle had to be crossed twice to be considered breached. There were several 
                different types of obstacles that could be on the field that rotated in and out every match, with 5 
                obstacles on the field at a time.
                Another challenge of the game was to launch a foam ball into either a goal at the top of the castle or 
                a goal at the bottom of the tower. The goal at the top of the tower was worth the most points. In the 
                endgame robots had to either park on the angled platform or climb by grabbing onto a bar and lifting 
                themselves off the ground.

                <br><br>
                Our robot in 2016 was named "Soup Shot" after a prototype ball shooter knocked over a student's cup of 
                ramen noodles at our shop. We used "West Coast Drive" for our robot drive base, which is a 6 wheel drive 
                system with 3 wheels on each side of the robot and the center wheel on each side dropped an 1/8th of an inch. 
                This allowed for easier and smoother turns. This year we went with larger 8 inch wheels because we had to climb 
                over various obstacles on the field. Our robot was also designed to fit underneath the "low bar", which was a 
                bar ___ inches high, requiring robots to be short to travel underneath it. In addition to the lower bar, our robot 
                could also cross many other obstacles on the field. There was a catapult style ball launcher inside of the 
                robot designed to throw the ball through the upper goal of the tower.

                <br><br>
                We attended the Arizona North Regional, Las Vegas Regional, and World Championships in St. Louis that year. 
                At Las Vegas we were Regional Finalists and the entire finalist alliance earned an invitation to the World 
                Championships. At the world championships we competed in the Carson division and finished 51/75 in the division.

                <br><br>
                At the 2016 Arizona North Regional, one of our mentors won the Woodie Flowers Award, which is an award recognizing 
                an ourstanding mentor who has made an important impact on their team and community.
