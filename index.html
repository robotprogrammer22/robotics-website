				Team 60 is a community FIRST Robotics Competition team based out of Kingman, Arizona. 
				Founded in 1996, Team 60 robotics has celebrated their 25th season in 2022. 
				Team members are from several schools throughout the Kingman area, as well as homeschooled students, and are 
				attending 7-12th grade. Some of our current members are from Kingman High School, Lee Williams High School, Kingman Academy of Learning 
				High School, White Cliffs Middle School, and Kingman Middle School. We welcome any students between 7-12th grades who have an interest 
				in robotics and are interested in learning new skills.
				
				<br><br>
				Every year, we receive a new challenge in January and have about 6-8 weeks to design, engineer, 
				prototype, build, program, and test a new robot before our first regional event in early-mid March. 
				The tasks and challenges the robot must complete are different every year, requiring students to 
				design for tasks they have not encountered before.
				
				<br><br>
				Our program runs year round. Even after competitions are over, we continue to meet at 
				our shop. We typically have many projects going and host classes for members to learn 
				about different robotics concepts. Some of the classes we host are 
				programming, soldering, electrical, machining, mechanical concepts, photography, 3D printing 
				AutoCAD and design, and more.
			</p>
			<h2>It's more than just robots</h2>
			<p class="center">
				FIRST is a program that encourages every student to learn new skills, 
				have fun, and give back to their communities. 
				Throughout the year, we also participate in many community outreach and community service events. 
				We believe in giving back to our communities and participate in events such as: toy drives for 
				the local hospital, library book sales, 
				We also believe in introducing students to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) 
				and local robotics programs. We often give presentations for schools and community organizations 
				that include robot demonstrations and fun activities for kids. In addition we also give presentations 
				for local businesses and sponsors.
				
				<br><br>
				It's not all about the robots.
				<br>
				As FIRST says, "FIRST is the one sport where everyone can go pro." 
				Students learn skills that are useful throughout their whole lives and careers. 
				Whether it's teamwork or skills in business, presentations, mechanical, electrical, 
				machining, programming, or another area, all students can take away something from 
				this program that can help them in their lives. Several of our students have discovered 
				the field they would like to have a career in from participating in Team 60. 
				Students can learn many concepts that can give a head start in college, 
				or open the doors for internships and employment right out of high school. 
				There are many scholarships offered at universities across the country for students who graduate from 
				FIRST programs.
			</p>
			<p class="center bold">
				<br><br>
				We always emphasize that no experience is required to get involved with FIRST or robotics. 
				All you need is a desire to learn something new.
