			<p>
				Team 60 was founded at Kingman High School in 1996 by an engineer at Laron Inc.
				Team 60's first season in FRC was 1997 competing in the "Toroid Terror" challenge.
				Eventually, the team expanded to include Kingman Academy of Learning High School, in addition to Kingman High School.
				As Kingman grew, the team also welcomed students from Lee Williams High School as well as homeschool students.
				Now the team also includes students in 7th grade and up.
