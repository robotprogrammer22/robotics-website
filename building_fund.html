			<h1>Building Fund</h1>
			<p>
				Team 60 has started a project to build a community robotics center 
				on Kingman High School's campus. This building will provide a space 
				for our team to work on, machine, program, and test robots. It will 
				also provide a space that other community robotics programs can use.
				<br><br>
				Currently the project has been started, but we are still raising 
				additional funding. Donations can be made directly to our account 
				at Foothills bank or sent to Kingman Robotics at PO Box 6492 Kingman, AZ.
				<br><br>
				For more information, please contact us at firstteam60robotics@gmail.com
