			<h1>2014</h1>
			<h2>Arrial Assist</h2>
			<p class="center">
				Arrial Assist was the game for the 2014 season. In this game, 2 alliances of 3 robots each had 
                to take a giant exercise ball and take it from one end of the field to the other and score it either 
                in a goal in the air, or one down on the ground for lower points. The amount of points per ball scored 
                increased depending on how many robots on the alliance helped to score the ball, and if the ball was passed 
                over the 'trus', which was a giant bar going across the middle of the field.
                <br><br>
                We competed at the Arizona Regional and the Las Vegas Regional in 2014.
