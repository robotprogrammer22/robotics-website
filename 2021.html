			<h2>Infinite Recharge</h2>
			<p class="center">
				In 2020 FIRST announced the game Infinite Recharge. This game involved launching foam dodgeballs 
                through a goal and climbing onto a tilting bar. The game release animation can be seen below. 
                Unfortunately, due to covid, our robot, Squishy, never got to compete in any in person competitions. 
                The 2020 season was cancelled partway through, and only a few teams were able to compete at an in person 
                event before it was cancelled. In 2021, a modified remote version of the game was introduced. Challenges 
                included launching the ball through the same goal that was supposed to be used in the previous season, as 
                well as various driving obstacle course challenges. FIRST also introduced a game design challenge this year 
                where teams had an opportunity to come up their own game ideas for future seasons.
