				The 2023 FIRST Robotics Competition game was released on January 7, 2023. Team 60 attended two regionals this season: 
				Arizona East and the Las Vegas regional. Team 60 finished in the semifinals for both events.
				<br><br>
				Our 2023 robot is named "Redux" (Re-do). Our robot was capable of placing both cones and cubes into the 
				scoring grid at all levels, as well as being able to balance on the charging station at the end of the match. 
				Our robot uses what is known in FIRST as "west-coast drive", which is a 6 wheel drive train with an 1/8th inch drop 
				on the center wheel to allow for easier turns.
