				The challenge for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition season was called Rapid React. 
				In Rapid React, robots had to pick up balls, called cargo, and score them either in 
				the upper or lower goal. At the end of the match robots also had to climb up slanted 
				bars and got more points the higher they could climb.

				<br><br>
				
				Our robot, Madame Mayhem, could score two cargo at a time in the low goal, and climb 
				up to the highest climbing bar. Madame Mayhem used a "west coast drive" style drive base, 
				which is a 6 wheel drive with 3 wheels per side and the center wheel dropped an 1/8th of 
				an inch to allow for easier turning.
				
				<br><br>

				For this season, team 60 competed at the Arizona North and Las Vegas regionals. In Arizona 
				North, the team was captain of the finalist alliance. In Las Vegas, the team was captain of 8th seed 
				alliance and finished in the quarterfinals. Team 60 also received the Gracious Professionalism Award 
				in Las Vegas.
