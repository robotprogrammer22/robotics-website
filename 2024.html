				The challenge for the 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition season is called Crescendo. 
				The game released on January 6, 2024. In Crescendo, robots must pick up rings, 
				called notes, and score them into a tower (the speaker), and in a lower scoring 
				area (the amp). In the last 30 seconds of the game, robots must drive over to the 
				stage and hang off of a chain. Above each climbing chain, there is a post, called 
				a microphone, that the human player must throw a specially marked note onto to "spotlight" 
				a robot. The alliance with the most ranking points wins the match. See the game animation 
				below for more information and feel free to watch us in person or on Twitch when we attend 
				our regionals this year!
