				The challenge for the 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition season is called Crescendo. 
				The game released on January 6, 2024. In Crescendo, robots must pick up rings, 
				called notes, and score them into a tower (the speaker), and in a lower scoring 
				area (the amp). In the last 30 seconds of the game, robots must drive over to the 
				stage and hang off of a chain. Above each climbing chain, there is a post, called 
				a microphone, that the human player must throw a specially marked note onto to "spotlight" 
				a robot. The alliance with the most ranking points wins the match. See the game animation 
				below for more information.
				<br><br>
				In 2024 we competed at the Arizona Valley Regional and the Las Vegas Regional. In Arizona Valley
				we were semifinalists. We won the Team Spirit Award and one of our mentors received the Volunteer of the
				Year Award. In Las Vegas we were semifinalists.
				<br><br>
				At the end of our 2024 season, we competed in several off season events. We competed in the 
				Arizona Robotics League events in August and September, finishing as semifinalists in both events. We 
				also competed at the Arizona State Championship and the Arizona Robotics League Championship. In November we 
				also attended Beach Blitz.
