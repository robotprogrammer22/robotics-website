			<h1>2017</h1>
			<h2>Steamworks</h2>
			<p class="center">
				In 2017 the challenge "Steamworks" was released. In Steamworks, robots had to deliver large 
                plastic gears to the airship in the middle of the field, which was a tower in the middle of 
                the playing field that a human player stood on. Once a gear was delivered, the human player 
                had to use a pulley system to pull up the delivered gear and then place it in the proper 
                position to spin a propeller on the airship. Another goal was to deliver "fuel" (wiffle balls), 
                into a goal in the air. In the last 30 seconds of the match, robots had to climb onto the airship 
                using a rope. If robots climbed the rope and pressed the button at the top, they got points for 
                a successful climb.

                <br><br>

                Our robot in 2017 was called "Deputy Dawg." For this robot we used what is called West Coast Drive, 
                which is a 6 wheel drive system, 3 wheels on each side of the bot, with the center wheel dropped an 1/8th 
                of an inch to allow for smoother and faster turning.

                <br><br>

                In the 2017 season, team 60 attended both the Arizona North Regional, and the Las Vegas Regional. 
                The team also qualified for the world championships and competed in the Newton division in Houston. 
                We were regional finalists at Arizona North and quarterfinalists in Las Vegas. We were ranked 33/67 
                in the Newton division at the world championships as well.
